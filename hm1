The dataset appears to be a typical Titanic dataset containing information on passengers. Key columns include:
	•	PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
	•	Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
	•	Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3).
	•	Name: Name of the passenger.
	•	Sex: Gender of the passenger.
	•	Age: Age of the passenger.
	•	SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
	•	Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
	•	Ticket: Ticket number.
	•	Fare: Fare paid for the ticket.
	•	Cabin: Cabin number (missing values).
	•	Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Next, let’s explore the dataset by visualizing the key attributes and relationships. I’ll create the following visualizations:
	1.	Survival Rate by Gender
	2.	Survival Rate by Passenger Class
	3.	Age Distribution of Passengers
	4.	Fare Distribution
	5.	Survival Rate by Embarked Port

Here are the key insights from the graphs based on the Titanic dataset:
	1.	Survival Rate by Gender: The survival rate for females was significantly higher than for males, with females having a much higher probability of survival.
	2.	Survival Rate by Passenger Class: Passengers in Class 1 had the highest survival rate, followed by those in Class 2. Passengers in Class 3 had the lowest survival rate.
	3.	Age Distribution of Passengers: The majority of passengers were relatively young, with a peak in the 20–30 age range. There were fewer older passengers.
	4.	Fare Distribution: Most passengers paid a low fare, with a few individuals paying significantly higher amounts. The distribution is highly skewed to the right.
	5.	Survival Rate by Embarked Port: Passengers who boarded from port ‘C’ (Cherbourg) had the highest survival rate, followed by port ‘S’ (Southampton) and port ‘Q’ (Queenstown).
