The dataset appears to be a typical Titanic dataset containing information on passengers. Key columns include:
	•	PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
	•	Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
	•	Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3).
	•	Name: Name of the passenger.
	•	Sex: Gender of the passenger.
	•	Age: Age of the passenger.
	•	SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
	•	Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
	•	Ticket: Ticket number.
	•	Fare: Fare paid for the ticket.
	•	Cabin: Cabin number (missing values).
	•	Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Next, let’s explore the dataset by visualizing the key attributes and relationships. I’ll create the following visualizations:
	1.	Survival Rate by Gender
	2.	Survival Rate by Passenger Class
	3.	Age Distribution of Passengers
	4.	Fare Distribution
	5.	Survival Rate by Embarked Port
